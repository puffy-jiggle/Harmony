/**
 * Usage Notes:
 * - This component is accessible via the /test route
 * - Demonstrates basic routing with React Router's Link component
 * - Shows minimal DaisyUI button styling
 * 
 * Development Tips:
 * - Use this as a template for new routed components
 * - Add more DaisyUI components as needed (refer to DaisyUI docs)
 * - For new routes, remember to add them in index.tsx
 * 
 * Styling:
 * - Currently uses minimal styling with Tailwind's p-8 and mt-4
 * - DaisyUI's btn and btn-secondary classes for the back button
 * - Can be expanded with more Tailwind/DaisyUI classes as needed
